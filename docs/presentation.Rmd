# Git

* Version Control System
* Developed by Linus Torvalds to work on the Linux Kernel with mutliple people
* Mainly for Code, but useful for many other things

# Why Version Control?

* "forces" some good habits
* structured thinking
* structured working in small chunks
* goal-oriented
* (supports Open-Source development)


# Get git

* [https://git-scm.com/download/](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* preinstalled on most GNU/Linux distributions
* GUI Versions available (NOT recommended for beginners)

# Git workflow

* Application with a learning curve
* Simple but easy to mess something up


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git status
git add
git commit
```



# Git Branches - The tree model

![*https://bluecast.tech/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/git-switch-branch*](https://bluecast.tech/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/git-switch-branch-.png)

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git branch # to create a new branch
git switch # to switch between branches
git merge  # to merge two branches together
```



# .gitignore

* exclude files and filetypes
* typical example for an R project:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
.Rhistory
/data/
*.tif
```



# GitHub

* platform for code sharing
* smooth integration into the git workflow
* makes collaborations easy
* *"Developers Social Media"*

# Github

* Core unit: **A repository**
* Contains files, code, documentation, installation guide, (data)...

## Additional features

* Wiki
* Issue - Tracker
* Automation
* ...


# Github related commands

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote
git push
git pull
```

* Forking
* Pull requests


# Rstudio Integration

Rstudio can serve as a powerful user interface for git!



# Real World Example: Bugfix

There is a small Bug in the r-package `getSpatialData`

[https://github.com/16EAGLE/getSpatialData](https://github.com/16EAGLE/getSpatialData)


In the file `R/internal_clients.R` Line 40:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# wrong:
lapply(uuid, function(x) content(.get(paste0(cred[3], "/odata/v1/Products('", x, "')/", field), cred[1], cred[2])))

# correct:
lapply(uuid, function(x) content(.get(paste0(cred[3], "odata/v1/Products('", x, "')/", field), cred[1], cred[2])))
```


**Which workflow do you propose?**








# Github Pages

Github can serve webpages!

* markdown based
* syntax highlighting

Contents of docs/index.Rmd

# Real World Example: Publications

Include a repository in your scientific publication

"All computations were done in R (Version 4.0.2; [38]). All presented methods are provided as the R-package uavRmp (https://gisma.github.io/uavRmp/) and the Metashape Python Scripts (https://github.com/envima/MetashapeTools)."
