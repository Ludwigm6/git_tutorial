# git

* Version Control System
* Developed by Linus Torvalds to work on the Linux Kernel with mutliple people
* Mainly for Code, but useful for many other things

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Git-logo.svg)


# Why Version Control?

* "forces" some good habits
    * structured thinking
    * structured working in small chunks
    * goal-oriented
* (supports Open-Source development)


# Get git

* [https://git-scm.com/download/](https://git-scm.com/download/)
* preinstalled on most GNU/Linux distributions
* GUI Versions available

# git Workflow

* Application with a learning curve
* Simple but easy to mess something up
* Core unit: **A repository**


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git init    # to start
```


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git status # to get infos

git add    # to add files to the tracking system

git commit # to define changed files as the new standard
```



# Git Branches - The Tree Model

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git branch # to create a new branch

git switch # to switch between branches

git merge  # to merge two branches together
```



# .gitignore

* exclude files and filetypes
* typical example for an R project:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
.Rhistory
/data/
*.tif
```



# GitHub

* platform for code sharing
* smooth integration into the git workflow
* makes collaborations easy
* *"Developers Social Media"*
* scientific communication

# GitHub

* "Cloud storage" for git repositories
* Contains files, code, documentation, installation guide, (data)...

## Additional Features

* Wiki
* Issue - Tracker
* Automation
* ...


# Github Related Commands

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote    # to get infos about remote

git push      # to send commits to remote

git pull      # to download commits from remote
```


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone     # to download a repository
```


## Further Actions

* Forking
* Pull requests

# Rstudio Integration

Rstudio is a powerful user interface for git!

# Real World Example: R packages


[https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST](https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST)



Package Page created with `pkgdown`

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("CAST")

devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST")

remotes::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST")

```

# Real World Example: Bugfix

There is a small Bug in the r-package `getSpatialData`

[https://github.com/16EAGLE/getSpatialData](https://github.com/16EAGLE/getSpatialData)


In the file `R/internal_clients.R` Line 40:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# wrong:
lapply(uuid, function(x) content(.get(paste0(cred[3], "/odata/v1/Products('", x, "')/", field), cred[1], cred[2])))

# correct:
lapply(uuid, function(x) content(.get(paste0(cred[3], "odata/v1/Products('", x, "')/", field), cred[1], cred[2])))
```


**Which workflow do you propose?**


# Real World Example: Publications

> All computations were done in R (Version 4.0.2; [38]). All presented methods are provided as the R-package uavRmp (https://gisma.github.io/uavRmp/) and the Metashape Python Scripts (https://github.com/envima/MetashapeTools). - Ludwig et al. 2020

> The ELC10 dataset is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4407051 JavaScript and R code to reproduce ELC10 is available here: https://github.com/NINAnor/ELC10 - Venter et al. 2021



# GitHub Pages

Github can serve webpages!

* markdown based
* syntax highlighting
